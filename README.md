# Overview

This project, titled "Hello World - Animated Edition," is an interactive web application designed to enhance my skills in frontend development, focusing on animations, DOM manipulation, and CSS styling with Tailwind CSS. The application displays a greeting message that changes language each time the user clicks a button, with additional animations that create a visually dynamic experience.

The purpose of creating this software is to improve my understanding of JavaScript animations, CSS transitions, and interactivity on web applications. By building this project, I aimed to explore how small UI elements can make a simple "Hello World" application more engaging and interactive.
